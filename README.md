## Build Documentation
The projects documentation is automatically generated and provided using "Read the Docs".
Some files, needed to build the "read the docs" documentation must be generated to be up to
date and along with the code. Rerun **`ExecuteForReadTheDocs.java`** to autogenerate these
referenced files.
